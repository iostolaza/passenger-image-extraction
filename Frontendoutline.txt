Typical Timeline (for a basic working prototype):
1–2 days:

Basic Angular/React/Vue SPA with a multi-step form.

Camera/photo upload with cropping/overlay preview (using JS/HTML5/canvas or a library).

State-driven routing (pages: capture, review, edit, confirm).

Basic Express backend.

S3 upload (using AWS SDK, as you do in Python).

3–7 days:

Custom camera overlays (box guides, cropping).

Full image upload and S3 integration.

Backend API to run OCR (using Python, Node, or serverless).

Email notification after submission.

Polished UX: validation, error messages, etc.

What You Get With Angular/React/Vue:
Camera:

Full control. You can use <video> for live preview, add a rectangle overlay, control cropping, and even real-time filters.

Libraries:

react-webcam, ngx-webcam for Angular, html5-qrcode for scanning, fabric.js for overlays.

Save as image, then upload to backend.

Form Prefill:

After user captures or uploads, send the image to backend (Flask, FastAPI, or Node/Express).

Run your Python OCR code (can run in Flask/FastAPI microservice, or even on Lambda).

Return extracted data as JSON, prefill the frontend form.

Edit, Review, Submit:

User can review, edit, and confirm the submission (MUI, Bootstrap, PrimeNG, Ant Design—pick your style).

Send full form (JSON) to backend for saving and S3 upload.

Email:

Backend triggers Zoho or SendGrid email with confirmation.

Id like to organize all the scripts headers, libraries, classes and method calls.

Lets do a deep analysis as which libraries and methods are being used by the script. 
Remove the rest. 
Organize them. 

Produce just the headers or the changed edited part of the script and name.
